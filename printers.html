<h1>Impact Printers vs Non-Impact Printers</h1>

<p>
    Printers are essential devices that produce a hard copy of electronic documents. There are two main types of printers: impact printers and non-impact printers.
</p>

<h2>Impact Printers</h2>

<p>
    Impact printers use a mechanism that physically strikes an inked ribbon against the paper. This direct contact creates characters or images on the paper. Examples of impact printers include dot matrix printers and daisy wheel printers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Advantages of Impact Printers:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Durable and can handle multi-part forms.</li>
        <li>Suitable for printing in challenging environments.</li>
        <li>Cheaper in terms of consumables.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Non-Impact Printers</h2>

<p>
    Non-impact printers, on the other hand, do not involve physical contact between the printing mechanism and the paper. They use various technologies such as laser or inkjet to transfer ink or toner onto the paper without striking it directly.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Advantages of Non-Impact Printers:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Produce high-quality prints with sharp text and graphics.</li>
        <li>Generally quieter and faster than impact printers.</li>
        <li>More versatile and suitable for various printing needs.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    In summary, the choice between impact and non-impact printers depends on factors like the desired print quality, speed, and the specific printing requirements.
